# PortableMirror Mod for Resonite
The Portable Mirror mod is a mod that allows you to create userspace Mirrors similar to the personal mirror in VRC or CVR. The benefits of this being a mod, not a facet or install allows it to add buttons to your context menu while mirrors spawn in userspace, spawning mirrors when opening the full-body calibrator, not adding extra flux to your avatar that has to be reinstalled for each avatar. also having a detailed settings page in mod settings.


Some of the features of this mod are possible to do without a mod if you prefer not to use a mod use the modless version in my public folder. ```resrec:///U-HamoCorp/R-e5c234a3-c4d4-4645-af54-7a80d388605c```
